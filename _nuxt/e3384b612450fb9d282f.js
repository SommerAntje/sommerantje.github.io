It will generate HTML for every one of your routes and put it inside of its own file in the **dist/ directory**\n\n```\n generate: {\n    routes: [\n      \'/en\', \'404\'\n    ]\n    .concat(blogsDe.map(w => `/blog/${w}`))\n    .concat(blogsEn.map(w => `/en/blog/${w}`))\n  }\n```\n\n## Configure your User page site to serve static content\n\nGo to the **settings tab** in GitHub and navigate to **pages** to set the configuation for the gh-pages branch.\n\nI selected the **gh-pages branch as source** and **serve the static content from the root** folder, this setting has the benefit of not having to maintain two repositories at the same time, one for holding the source code and one for serving the build artifacts.\n\n<image-responsive\n  imageURL="blog/deploy-nuxt-app-to-github-pages/create_user_site.png"\n  :width="\'952\'"\n  :height="\'509\'"\n  alt="create user site" />\n\n**_What is the gh-pages branch for?_**\n\nThe gh-pages branch is where GitHub will look for static content to serve, such as build artifacts. \n\nA gh-pages branch can either be created by command line from your local repository\n\n  ```sh\n  git checkout -b gh-pages\n  git push --set-upstream origin gh-pages \n  ```\n\nor by using [Paeceiris GitHub Actions](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages) as part of the configuration of a CD workflow.\n## Serve your website from a custom domain \n\nAfter running a test deployment, my User page site was available on <inline-code>https://sommerantje.github.io</inline-code>\nnow I wanted to have my custom domain being prompted to my User page site.\n\n_Read on GitHub Docs [configure a custom domain](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site#configuring-an-apex-domain)_\n\n\n**Configure a custom domain on GitHub**\n\nTo configure a custom domain in GitHub, go to the settings tab, navigate to pages and add your custom domain accordingly.\n\n<image-responsive\n  imageURL="blog/deploy-nuxt-app-to-github-pages/custom-domain.jpg"\n  :width="\'952\'"\n  :height="\'509\'"\n  alt="create user site" />\n\n**Set up your DNS and CNAME configuration**\n\n**_What is an apex domain?_**\n\nAn Apex domain, is a root domain that does not contain a subdomain, for example <inline-code>antje-sommer.de</inline-code> is an\napex domain because it doesn\'t have a subdomain.\n\n<inline-code>www.antje-sommer.de</inline-code> is not an apex domain because it contains the subdomain part www.\n\nTo point to an apex domain I use an A record pointing to the server\'s IP. \n**Note:** _This solution doesn\'t scale and isn\'t viable for cloud platforms, where multiple and frequently changing backends are responsible for responding to requests._\n\n**_What is a CNAME record?_**\n\nAn IP address isn’t always linked with one domain name. Several names can also refer to the same IP address. To enable this, the DNS uses CNAME records.\n\nA Canonical Name record is a type of resource record in the Domain Name System that maps one domain name to another. This can prove convenient when running multiple services from a single IP address. One can, for example, point _ftp.example.com_ and _www.example.com_ to the DNS entry for _example.com_ , which in turn has an A record which points to the IP address.\n\nI also use CNAME records for my subdomain pointing to <inline-code>sommerantje.github.io</inline-code>.\n\nFor having these changes be made I had to contact the provider service to add the DNS settings like the following:\n\n```DNS settings\n  DNS A Records for my domain antje-sommer.de:\n  185.199.108.153\n  185.199.109.153\n  185.199.110.153\n  185.199.111.153\n  \n  A CNAME Record from www.antje-sommer.de to sommerantje.github.io\n\n```\n\nAs last steps I had to set my apex domain to the cname configuration inside the **cd.yml** where I have set up the peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3 for the deployment.\n\n```\n- name: Deploy\n      uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3\n      with:\n        github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n        publish_dir: ./dist\n        cname: antje-sommer.de\n```\n\nAnd add a **CNAME** file to my directory on the root level containing my subdomain, to complete the mapping.\n\n```CNAME\n  www.antje-sommer.de\n```\n\n**Enforce HTTPS**\n\nAfter the DNS changes have been added enforce https inside of the GitHub page settings to have your site served from https only.\n\n<image-responsive\n  imageURL="blog/deploy-nuxt-app-to-github-pages/custom_domain_setup.png"\n  :width="\'952\'"\n  :height="\'509\'"\n  alt="create user site" />\n\n## What problems have I encountered \n\n**Testing GitHub Actions is not really possible**\n\nI had to perform test deployments with minimal changes to the master branch, for \ntesting my CD.\n\nThis is also how I encountered an issue within my CD configuration, as I had executed a deployment each time when I pushed to master but also with each pull request, caused by the following configuration inside of the **cd.yml**:\n\n```\non: \n    push:\n      branches:\n        - master\n    pull_request:\n      branches:\n        - master\n```\n\nI needed pull requests not to trigger a deployment because I am  developing my blog content on WIP:Pull requests as part of my personal workflow.\n\n**Wrong CNAME configuration**\n\nAt the beginning I\'ve missed adding my apex domain to the cname configuration within the deployment action and creating a CNAME file in my directory contaning my subdomain.\n\nThat caused a deletation of my custom domain entry within the GitHub pages settings with the consequence that each time a deployment action has been executed my domain entry appears to be empty and therefore my User page site down.\n\n```\n- name: Deploy\n      uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3\n      with:\n        github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n        publish_dir: ./dist\n        cname: antje-sommer.de\n``',html:'<p>Given you want to host a web application made with nuxt.js that includes a blog, which dynamically requests each post\nto GitHub and creates a static version in the build (pre-rendering SPA) -
