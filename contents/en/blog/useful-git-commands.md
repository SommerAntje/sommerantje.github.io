This blog post documents the commands I've been using almost every day and how I am also going to provide them as gist
on [gist.github](https://gist.github.com)
## Technologies and tools that I've been using

- git commands
- npm/yarn commands
- [gist.github](https://gist.github.com)

When I first learned about GitHub and git I used to work with common Atlassian tools like Sourcetree, but over the years I got more and more into working directly over the commandline. 

I usually work with the terminal in VS Code (IDE).
