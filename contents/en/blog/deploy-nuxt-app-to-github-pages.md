  Deploy a nuxt app to GitHub Pages by creating a workflow through GitHub actions and host your website using a custom domain
---

Given you want to host a web application made with nuxt.js that includes a blog, which dynamically requests each post
to GitHub and creates a static version in the build (pre-rendering SPA) - that also should be served from a custom domain other than the default github.io preset.

This blog post documents the steps needed to be exectued in order to deploy such a web app to GitHub Pages.
### Technologies that I've been using

- A pre-rendering SPA _nuxt.js, vue.js and markdown_
- GitHub Pages
- [Paeceiris GitHub Actions](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages)
